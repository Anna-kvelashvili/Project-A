          <h6 class="history-h6">How it all Began 1834: Gottlieb Daimler.</h6>
          <p class="history-p">
            'It's not the idea, it's the implementation that counts.' Gottlieb
            Daimler is born on 17 March 1834 in Schorndorf. After training as a
            gunsmith and working in France, he attends the Polytechnic School in
            Stuttgart from 1857 to 1859. After completing various technical
            activities in France and England, he starts work as a draftsman in
            Geislingen in 1862. At the end of 1863, he is appointed workshop
            inspector in a machine tool factory in Reutlingen, where he meets
            Wilhelm Maybach in 1865. In 1872, he becomes Technical Director of
            the gas engine manufacturer Deutz Gasmotorenfabrik, where he becomes
            familiar with Otto's four-stroke technology. After differences with
            the Managing Director, he leaves the company in 1882. Daimler sets
            up a development workshop in his greenhouse at his Cannstatt villa
            to concentrate on developing petrol-driven four-stroke engines.
            Working with Wilhelm Maybach in 1884, he develops an internal
            combustion engine known today as the 'Grandfather Clock'. With its
            compact, low-weight design, the machine forms the basis for
            installation in a vehicle. The costs of trial operations soon
            consume Daimler's entire fortune, however, so he is obliged to find
            business partners. He founds 'Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft' on 28
            November 1890 together with Max Duttenhofer and his business partner
            Wilhelm Lorenz. But while Duttenhofer wants to produce stationary
            engines, Daimler prefers to focus on vehicle production, and a
            dispute ensues. After Wilhelm Maybach resigns in 1891 due to
            unacceptable terms of contract, Daimler resorts to a ruse. He
            continues to build engines with Maybach, but the patents are all in
            his name. The increasingly tense relationship with Duttenhofer and
            Lorenz lead them to exclude Daimler as a shareholder. A
            deterioration in finances leads to stagnating technical development,
            which prompts DMG to attempt to reinstate Maybach in 1895. He
            refuses, pointing out that he would not come back without Daimler.
            In the end, commercial pressures result in both of them returning to
            the company. Thanks to the Phoenix engine built by Maybach, the
            Daimler engine gains popularity abroad. A group of English
            industrialists are prepared to pay 350,000 Marks for licensing
            rights. Maybach is appointed Technical Director of DMG, and Gottlieb
            Daimler receives a position on the Technical Board and becomes the
            Inspector General of the Supervisory Board. The return of both men
            to DMG is an unexpected boost for the company. Gottlieb Daimler
            enjoys this rapid development for only a short period of time. He
            dies of heart disease on 6 March 1900.

          <p class="history-p">
            Before World War I, Walter Owen Bentley and his brother, Horace
            Millner Bentley, sold French DFP cars in Cricklewood, North London,
            but W.O, as Walter was known, always wanted to design and build his
            own cars. At the DFP factory, in 1913, he noticed an aluminium
            paperweight and thought that aluminium might be a suitable
            replacement for cast iron to fabricate lighter pistons. The first
            Bentley aluminium pistons were fitted to Sopwith Camel aero engines
            during the First World War. The same day that the Paris Peace
            Conference to end World War I started, Walter Owen ("W.O.") Bentley
            founded Bentley Motors Limited, on January 18, 1919[18] and
            registered Bentley Motors Ltd. in August 1919. In October he
            exhibited a car chassis (with a dummy engine) at the London Motor
            Show.[19] Ex-Royal Flying Corps officer Clive Gallop designed an
            innovative four-valves-per-cylinder engine for the chassis. By
            December the engine was built and running. Delivery of the first
            cars was scheduled for June 1920, but development took longer than
            estimated so the date was extended to September 1921.[19] The
            durability of the first Bentley cars earned widespread acclaim, and
            they competed in hill climbs and raced at Brooklands.[20] Bentley's
            first major event was the 1922 Indianapolis 500, a race dominated by
            specialized cars with Duesenberg racing chassis. They entered a
            modified road car driven by works driver Douglas Hawkes, accompanied
            by riding mechanic H. S. "Bertie" Browning.[21] Hawkes completed the
            full 500 miles (800 km) and finished 13th with an average speed of
            74.95 miles per hour (120.62 km/h) after starting in 19th
            position.[22] The team was then rushed back to England to compete in
            the 1922 RAC Tourist Trophy.
